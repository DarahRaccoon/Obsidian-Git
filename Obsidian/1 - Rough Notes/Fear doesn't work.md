	At times, technical terms are being relayed to the public without sufficient explanation, or climate data are still being presented without enough context. When these happen, the public tends to draw away, feeling detached from the issue.

Malas prácticas en la comunicación del cambio climático, como el uso de tecnisismos sin suficiente explicación, alejan a las personas de actuar contra el cambio climático.

	According to the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED), “in order for climate science information to be fully absorbed by audiences, it must be actively communicated with appropriate language, metaphor, and analogy; combined with narrative storytelling; made vivid through visual imagery and experiential scenarios; balanced with scientific information; and delivered by trusted messengers in group settings.”

De acuerdo con el **CRED** (Centro para la Investigación de las Decisiones Ambientales), son necesarias una serie de *acciones para comunicar mejor* el tema del cambio climático:
- Usar lenguaje apropiado
	- Metáforas
	- Analogías
- Usar narrativas
- Uso de imágenes
.

	According to Susanne Moser and Lisa Dilling, making people act on climate change has become challenging because of a few things: “the characteristics of climate change itself, its politicization and institutionalization, cognitive and psychological ways of processing information, structural challengers pertaining to the media used for communication.”

De acuerdo con **Susanne Moser** y **Lisa Dilling**, hacer que las personas actuan contra el cambio climático se ha vuelto *dificil por*:
- Las características del tema en sí
- Su politización
- Su institucionalización
- Los medios usados para su comunicación
.

	The person you are talking to already have their set of values and beliefs. According to CRED, confirmation bias “makes people look for information that is consistent with what they already think, want, or feel, leading them to avoid, dismiss, or forget information that will require them to change their minds and, quite possibly, their behavior.”

Del **CRED**: El *sesgo de confirmación* hace que las personas busquen *infromación que respalda sus creencias previas*, esto para evitar enfrentarse a información que requeriría que cambien.

	According to Carolyn Gergoire, people want to avoid cognitive dissonance with confirmation bias. Dissonance is where people have inconsistency in thoughts and beliefs, which creates tension, especially if it requires changing behaviors.

De **Carolyn Gergoire**:
- *Disonancia cognitiva:* La tensión que alguien siente cuando  sus pensaminetos y sus creencias chocan
	- El *sesgo de confirmación* puede ser usado por las personas como *escape* de la disonancia cognitiva.
.

	According to CRED, people will eventually update their existing beliefs and perceptions by correcting misinformation. The catch? Communicators must be able to figure out the misconceptions of their audience on climate change, disconnect this misinformation, and replace it with new facts.

El **CRED** dice que las personas, con el tiempo, terminan por cambiar sus creencias fundamentadas en desinformación, y es trabajo de los comunicadores el guiar a las personas para reemplazar su desinformación sobre el cambio climático con información confiable.

	...too much facts can also backfire.

	There are many things that affect climate  change communication, not just in terms of  media platforms and how the message is  relayed to the public, but it is also important  to understand how the receiver of the  message processes information.

	According to a study from Dartmouth, “If people counterargue unwelcome information vigorously enough, they may end up with 'more attitudinally congruent information in mind than before the debate,'

Un punto importante al comunicar el cambio climático es conocer *como procesan la información* las personas, puesto que *mucha información puede ser contraproducente*.
Esto se conoce como el **efecto rebote** y cómo se mencionó anteriormente, consiste en que, al someter a las personas a argumentos que desafían sus creencias, ellos intentan defenderlas, y mientras más lo hacen, no solo se atan mas a sus creencias, sino aue, además, pueden terminar con creencias mas extremistas que las que tenían anterior al debate.

	David McRaney summarizes the backfire effect simply, “Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm.

De **David McRanney**: "Una vez que algo es añadido a tu colección de creencias, *lo proteges* del daño".

	According to Skeptical Science, there are two ways to deal with this: present information coupled with self-affirmation; and second, frame it in a way that doesn’t threaten their world views.

**Soluciones** para lidiar con esto de acuerdo con **Skeptical Science**:
1. Presenta la información junto con [...]
2. Enmarca en mensaje de una forma que no ataque sus creencias
.

	it is not only climate skeptics or climate deniers who have confirmation bias and experience backfire effect.

	The urge to use everything to our own advantage to help the cause will only lead to more misunderstanding and miscommunication,

	You will read many articles on the how communicating climate change (or any other issue), and most will tell you that an important thing to understand is to know your audience and frame your message accordingly.

	Matthew Nisbet warns us that framing doesn’t mean spinning news: “Framing, it should be noted, is not synonymous with placing a false spin on an issue, although some experts, advocates, journalists, and policymakers certainly spin evidence and facts.”

	In choosing how to frame your message, it might be useful to ask the following questions about your audience:  What are their demographics? Are they old or young? What level of education have they attained?  What do they do in their everyday lives? Do they experience climate change impacts directly? Do they see it first hand?  What do they care about? Do they care about the future? Or do they care more about what’s happening in the present?  Who do they listen to? Do they listen more to authority figures or do they distrust them?  Where do they get their information? Do they get it from news sources or do they get information from other people close by like neighbors and family members?

	According to Climate Outreach, values which people hold can also define whether or not they support environmental causes:

	People who identify strongly with ‘selfenhancing’ values (e.g. materialism, personal ambition) tend not to identify strongly with ‘self-transcending’ values (e.g. benevolence, respect for the environment).

	Uncertainty about the science proves to be a  challenge to communicators. According to Maxwell  Boykoff, “Uncertainty can be reframed as scientific  incompetence.”

	According to the Uncertainty Handbook by Adam  Corner et al., uncertainty is a friend of science and an  enemy of inaction. And there are 12 tips they offer to  help us communicate uncertainty
	1. Manage audience expectations
	2. Start with what you know, not with what you don’t  know
	3. Shift from “uncertainty” to “risk”  Most people are used with the idea of risk than  uncertainty, that’s why it can be more effective.
	4. Be clear about the type of risk you are talking about
	– causes, impacts, policies or solutions
	5. Understand what is driving people’s views
	6. The most important question is “when” not “if”
	7. Communicate through images and stories
	8. Highlight the positives of uncertainty.	If you talk about  uncertainty in a positive way, it creates hope, if you  talk about it in a
	9. Communicate effectively about climate impacts
	10. Have a conversation, not an argument
	11. Tell a human story

	A study by Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research found that fear is the most widely used emotion in communicating climate change.

	Saffron O’Neill and Sophie Nicholson-Cole from the Tyndall Center for Climate Research

	“Fearful representations of climate change appear to be memorable and may initially attract individuals’ attention. However, they can also act to distance and disempower individuals in terms of their sense of personal engagement with the issue.”

	Yale Project for Climate Change Communication The Role of Emotion in Global Warming Policy Support and Opposition

	“Researchers found that “worry” about climate change was the strongest predictor of support for policies to mitigate climate change. “Disgust,” on the other hand, was the strongest predictor of opposition to these policies. Interestingly, researchers also found that “fear” did not strongly correlate with support for policies to mitigate climate change.”

	In addition the research suggests that instilling of hope, a positive emotion, may lead to more engagement with the public.

	According to CRED, these 3 things might happen when you overuse emotional appeal:

	12. That your audience’s concern about your risk may lessen when exposed to other near-term threats  2. That your audience’s emotional system will get tired in the long run and will not remain engaged  3. That your audience will experience emotional numbing whereby overexposure to emotionally draining situations will eventually lead them to become apathetic

	13. Acknowledge that the audience has other  pressing issues.

	14. Gauge an audience’s degree of numbing

	CRED gives us 4  tips

	15. Decide what portfolio of risks they want to  make the public more aware of and then  demonstrate the connection between those  risks,

	16. Balance information that triggers an  emotional response with more analytic  information

	CASE STUDY:

	In the Caribbean, free concerts were held, an album was recorded, videos were produced. The CVF helped in campaigning inside the UNFCCC. There were many communications effort to make the public understand what the campaign was about and help put pressure inside the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.

	the message was brought closer to the public and the public was able to pressure governments to be more ambitious in their goals.

	The message, “1.5 to Stay Alive” was easy to understand, and was short and catchy enough to remember. The platforms used were important too.
